Good evening,

I read this week's text with a specific theme in mind - compassion for animals, plants, and nature. Ghandi once said, "[the] greatness of a nation and its moral progress can by the way its animals are treated." By understanding each unique perspective towards nature, we can make better inferences about each religion's value on life. In Buddhism, we see a reflection of this concern for all creatures in The Ox Who Won the Forfeit. The Ox is anthropomoratized to invoke empathy with the owner, and sympathy with the audience.

In reading through the Analects, though, there was little mention of animals, of nature. And, while Buddhism and Confucian share the similarity of primarily being inwardly-focused, they regard the man's outward experience differently. I came to find that I'm not the only one who noticed this criticism. Joseph Adler (1999) also argued that a "problem that does loom large in the Confucian tradition is its anthropocentrism, the traditional Confucian view of human beings as the "highest" form of life."

I specifically chose Confucianism and Buddhism because, from our Western perspective, they are more akin to philosophical perspectives than religions. The sacred texts of Christianity describe interactions with all walks of life.

Have a great evening!
