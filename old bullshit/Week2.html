<h1>
  Week 2
</h1>

<h2><i>
    Based on the Connolly textbook, discuss some relational database terminology, especially the various keys.</i>
</h2>

<p>
  Thanks for checking out my Week Two post. I like to use forum posts to practice HTML and CSS.
  This week, we're talking about the different types of keys used in relational databases.
  These 'keys' are essential for a relational system.
  Lets explore some of these keys in more detail.
</p>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="item1">
    <h3>Primary Keys</h3>
    <p>According to the Microsoft SQL Server developer reference, both Primary and Foreign Keys facilitate data
      integrity. The primary key is a way to ensure uniqueness among records. Sometimes these are sequential values,
      such as an incrementing counter. They may also be a combination of two values, such as Vendor ID and Product ID
      (VID/PID) or Serial Number and Model Number. In Microsoft SQL Server, a Primary Key can be comprised of up to 16
      columns. Combined-column primary keys are also referred to as Composite Keys.</p>
    <p>The primary key can also be thought of as an index value. The primary key will not repeat, but other columns can
      have repetitive data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="item2">
    <h3>Foregin Keys</h3>
    <p>Let's look at MariaDB's developer reference and see how Foreign Keys are used. These keys are used to ensure
      referential integrity. The reference eloquently suggests that a foreign key is
    </p>
    <blockquote>...a primary key in a foreign table.</blockquote>
    <p>
      When the Foreign key is defined, if one of the People are removed, the associated Vehicle can be deleted from with
      a single DB statement using a concept called 'cascading delete and update'.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="item3">
    <h3></h3>
    <h4>People Table</h4>
    <table class="tg">
      <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Malcolm Fitzcarraldo</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Brock Samson</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Rusty Venture</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Vehicle Table</h4>
    <table class="tg">
      <tr>
        <th>People ID</th>
        <th>Vehicle</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Nissan Stanza</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Dodge Charger</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>X1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

  </div>

  <div class="item4">
    <p>
      <h3>Other Keys</h3>
      Foreign and Primary Keys are by far the most common. But there are other types of Keys that have stricter
      definitions, such as Candidate, Super/Composite, and Alternate keys.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="item5">

    <p>
      Candidate Keys are another unique field respective to a record but does not refer to any specific data.

      Alternate Keys are essentially a secondary key. Consider a table that contains both a unique Student ID, and the Student's Email Address, or a table of MAC and IP addresses. In both cases, a duplicate value would cause a data integrity issue.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="item6">
    <h3>Question for the Class</h3>
    <p>Given these definitions, and the various Join statements as well, the question I pose to my classmates is:
      Suppose we wanted to join the Vehicle to the People in the table in block 2?</p>
  </div>
